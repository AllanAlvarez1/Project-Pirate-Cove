	//This is the Project of Allan Alvarez for Video Game Programming Class
	//The goal is to not just make a game but to understand how each piece connects to 
	//each other so that it is a true learning experience.
	//I have many thanks for YouTube videos concerning how to use color to read a spritesheet
	//or how color can be used to make a level with the help of an image manipulator.
	//KaarinGaming has my utmost thanks for helping me understand and explaining how a 
	//game can be made very simply and I express that I took all of his teachings to heart.
	//While the books did not help me much because they were confusing in some parts,
	//Youtube taught me many ways to run animations, create a GameWindow,
	//and how to properly code and organize a project in process. I learned about packages and
	//where to store values and how to bring those values to other classes. With that said,
	//this is my project, Pirate's Cove, a game where you must defeat all the enemies in the level
	//to be able to progress to the next one.
